"""Dump every table to timestamped CSVs in data/backups/.

    python backup.py

One run writes one CSV per table, each stamped with the same local
(America/Chicago) timestamp, and keeps the ten most recent runs. It also runs
weekly in GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/backup.yml), which keeps each
run's CSVs as a downloadable artifact. data/ is gitignored: it holds personal
information.

A run that fails part-way removes what it had written -- half a run would
look like a backup and not be one -- and exits non-zero, so a scheduled run
shows red.
